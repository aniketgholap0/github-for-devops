. Commands to setup git(local) to github
    1️⃣ git remote add origin https://github.com/aniketgholap0/github-for-devops.git
        #Adds a remote repository called origin to your local Git repo.
        After this, your local Git knows where to push and pull from.
    2️⃣ git remote -v
        #Shows all configured remotes with their URLs.
    3️⃣ git remote set-url origin https://(Your-PAT)@github.com/aniketgholap0/github-for-devops.git

        (not recommended on Windows)
    4️⃣ git remote remove origin

. After updating
| Command                   | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| `git commit -m "message"` | Commit the changes                   |
| `git push origin main`    | Push commits to GitHub (main branch) |

.Pull request(from github to local/git)
    | 1. commit changes in github
    | 2.`git pull origin main` in local   

.Clone And Fork
    Clone - Cloning creates a local copy of an existing repository on your computer.
            Use when you have write access
            Repository is copied from GitHub → your local machine.
            `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`
    
    Fork - fork creates a new copy of a repository in your own GitHub account.
           Use when You don’t have write access to the original repo.
           steps-1.Fork repo on GitHub
                 2.Clone your fork locally

.branches
    1.It allows parallel development.
    2.Changes in one branch do not affect others.
    3.The default branch is usually main.
    4.A branch is a pointer to a commit.
    
    head=> latest commit on your repo

    To add changes from one branch to another branch in github =>
        1.Pull request on github
        2.merge
    Pull same on local
        1.`git pull origin <branch>`

    Create a branch-git branch feature-login
    Switch to a branch-git checkout feature-login
    Create + switch (modern way)-git switch -c feature-login
    Deleting Branches-git branch -d feature-login

    1️⃣git merge - Combines the changes from one branch into another.
    2️⃣git fetch - Downloads new changes from the remote repository(brings remote branches to local).Downloads changes only
    3️⃣git pull - Fetches + integrates changes in one step(changes to remote branch brough to local).

.Hooks
    Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur.(.git/hooks/).
    Git hooks are shell-based
    Types-
        1.Client-side
        2.Server-side
    #Git blocks an action ONLY if a hook exits with a non-zero code.
    Correct Windows setup-
        .git/hooks/
        ├── pre-commit        (NO extension, shell wrapper)
        ├── pre-commit.ps1    (PowerShell logic)

.GitHub Actions
    GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) tool built into GitHub that lets you:
        -Automatically build
        -Test
        -Lint
        -Deploy code
    #Key Concepts-
        Workflow-an automated process.(.github/workflows/c-ci.yml)
        Event (on)-Defines when the workflow runs.
        Job-Jobs run on virtual machines called runners.
        Runner-machine that runs your job.(ubuntu-latest)
        Step-Steps run commands or actions.
        Action-reusable piece of automation.

        Basic Workflow Structure-
            name: C CI

            on:
                push:
                pull_request:

            jobs:
                build:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest

            steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v4

                - name: Compile
                run: gcc test.c -o test

            - name: Run
                run: ./test
